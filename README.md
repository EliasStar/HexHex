# HexHex
HexHex is a client mod for [Minecraft](https://www.minecraft.net/) using the [Fabric Mod Loader](https://fabricmc.net/).
It has no dependencies, not even [Fabric API](https://modrinth.com/mod/fabric-api).
Fully compatible with [Sodium](https://modrinth.com/mod/sodium), however NightVision might not work with some shaders.

## Features
A button looking like a fire charge is added to the player inventory screen, which when pressed opens a screen to toggle and configure the following features:

|      Name      |              Description              |
| :------------: | :-----------------------------------: |
| CreativeFlight |  Allows flying like in creative mode  |
|  EntityFlight  | Allows flying with rideable entities  |
|  NightVision   | Renders everything at full brightness |
|     NoFall     |        Negates most falldamage        |
|     X-Ray      |    Renders only whitelisted blocks    |
